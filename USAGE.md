# Usage Guide

## Basic Usage

### Running the Script

```bash
# Standard execution
python Keylogger_Detection_Script.py

# With administrator privileges (recommended)
sudo python Keylogger_Detection_Script.py  # Linux/macOS
# Right-click "Run as Administrator" on Windows
What Happens During Scan

Initialization: Script checks system compatibility
Process Scanning: Analyzes running processes
File System Scan: Searches for suspicious files
Registry Check: Scans Windows registry (Windows only)
Network Analysis: Checks active connections
Hook Detection: Identifies system hooks
Report Generation: Creates JSON report file

Expected Runtime

Small Systems: 2-5 minutes
Medium Systems: 5-15 minutes
Large Systems: 15-30 minutes

Understanding Results
Scan Output Interpretation
The script outputs real-time progress and final results:
Checking running processes...          # Stage 1
Checking for suspicious files...       # Stage 2 (longest)
Checking registry entries...           # Stage 3 (Windows only)
Checking network connections...        # Stage 4
Checking for system hooks...          # Stage 5
Risk Assessment
Low Risk (0-10 items):

System appears clean
Few or no suspicious patterns detected
Routine monitoring recommended

Medium Risk (11-100 items):

Some suspicious patterns found
Review flagged items carefully
Consider additional security measures

High Risk (100+ items):

Many suspicious items detected
Immediate review recommended
Consider professional security audit

Report Files
Generated reports contain:

Timestamp of scan
Detailed findings for each category
File paths, sizes, and modification dates
Reasons for flagging items
Overall risk assessment

Advanced Usage
Customizing the Scan
The script can be modified to:

Add custom file patterns
Exclude specific directories
Adjust sensitivity levels
Modify output formats

Automated Scanning
For regular monitoring:
python# Example: Daily automated scan
import schedule
import subprocess
import time

def run_scan():
    subprocess.run(['python', 'Keylogger_Detection_Script.py'])

schedule.every().day.at("02:00").do(run_scan)

while True:
    schedule.run_pending()
    time.sleep(1)
Integration with Other Tools
The JSON output can be integrated with:

Security information systems
Log analysis tools
Automated response systems
Reporting dashboards

# Troubleshooting Guide

## Common Issues

### Permission Errors

**Problem**: "Permission denied" or "Access denied" errors
**Solution**: 
```bash
# Run with administrator privileges
sudo python Keylogger_Detection_Script.py  # Linux/macOS
# Right-click and "Run as Administrator" on Windows
Missing Dependencies
Problem: ModuleNotFoundError for required packages
Solution:
bashpip install psutil requests python-dateutil colorama
Slow Performance
Problem: Script takes very long to complete
Causes:

Large number of files to scan
Slow disk I/O
Network drives included in scan

Solutions:

Run during off-peak hours
Exclude network drives
Use SSD instead of HDD if possible

High False Positive Rate
Problem: Many legitimate files flagged as suspicious
Common False Positives:

Development tools (Visual Studio, PyCharm, etc.)
System files with suspicious names
Antivirus components
Remote access software

Solutions:

Review flagged items manually
Check file signatures and certificates
Research unfamiliar processes online

Script Crashes
Problem: Script terminates unexpectedly
Debug Steps:

Check Python version (3.6+ required)
Verify all dependencies installed
Run with elevated privileges
Check available disk space
Review system logs for errors

Windows-Specific Issues
Problem: Registry scanning fails
Solution: Ensure script runs as Administrator
Problem: Windows Defender blocks script
Solution: Add exception for the script file
Linux/macOS-Specific Issues
Problem: Cannot access system directories
Solution: Run with sudo privileges
Problem: Registry scanning error
Note: Registry scanning is Windows-only, error is expected
Performance Optimization
Reducing Scan Time

Exclude unnecessary directories
Run on local drives only
Use faster storage (SSD)
Close unnecessary applications

Memory Usage
The script is designed to be memory-efficient:

Processes files in batches
Cleans up temporary data
Minimal memory footprint
